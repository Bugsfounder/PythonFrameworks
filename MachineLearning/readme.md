Notes:

Supervised learning: Machine is given the data i.e trained before asking for required output.

Types of Supervised Learning:

1) Classification: After training, if we show some new object with features, it says, in which class that new object belongs, out of predefined set of objects. e.g., cat or dog

2) Regression: After training, if we show new object with features, it gives us prediction about some value of label. e.g., house price prediction

Unsupervised learning: Without giving data, machine is asked for an appropriate output.

Types of Unsupervised learning:

1) Clustering: Grouping a set of objects into a group( called cluster)

2) Association: Establishing relationship among various variables of our dataset
